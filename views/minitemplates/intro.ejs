In 2020 due to the global pandemic caused by Covid-19, nearly one in three people in the world (2.37 billion) did not have access to adequate food. The pandemic showcased many of the weaknesses of the global supply chain and plunged many people into compromising situations where they lacked the ability to access sufficient and nutritious food that meets the needs and preferences of an active lifestyle.
As countries start to learn to work around the Covid-19 pandemic and global food supply chains start to recover, there is an ever increasing need to have reliable predictions on our sources of supply to prevent a relapse that forces more people into lacking access to adequate food.
China supplies over 20% of the world’s population with food and India is the largest agricultural producer accounting for 25% of the global supply. China is the world’s largest exporter of grains and is by far the world’s leading agricultural producer with the annual output in 2020 valued at $1.56 trillion. India had the second highest agricultural output at $403.5 billion in 2020, and of that, $382.2 billion was attributed to food production. 
With the ability to predict how much food India and China can produce, countries will have the ability to plan their food inventories accordingly. If there is a shortfall of food in the future, then there is a need to stockpile currently to prevent the surge in food prices when supply decreases in the future. Conversely, in the case of an abundance, countries can prepare to ensure that there is sufficient storage space for the excess food.
